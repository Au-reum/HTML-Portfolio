<h1>My Favorite movies of all time</h1>
<h2>Angela's top 3 movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron</h3>
<h4>2002 ‧ Family/Western ‧ 1h 24m</h4>
<p>This has always been my favorite movie since I was young, this might be my most watched movie 
   as well. I just really like horses, their resilience is inspiring. The culture that is represented
   in the movie is quite interesting as well. I was invested back then, not as much today but it 
   will remain as my top 1 among anything else.

<h3>2. A Christmas Carol</h3>
<h3>2009 ‧ Family/Fantasy ‧ 1h 36m</h3>
<p>Do I really have to explain myself with this one? this might be the best christmas movie out
   there in a long time. It's generational, the animation, the theme, the story, everything
   is great in this movie. Of course it has its flaws but the positives are greater than the 
   negatives in this case.

<h3>3. Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas</h3>
<h4>1999 ‧ Family/Comedy ‧ 1h 10m</h4>
<p>I don't really remember anything about the movie but for some reason the 3D animation
   stuck to me when I was a kid. That's all I really remember in this movie and yeah it's 
   about christmas stuff.
